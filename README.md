`pniedzielski`â€™s Stack Templates
================================

The `stack new` creates a new `stack` project based on a template,
which can be fetched from GitHub.  This repository contains my most
frequently-used Stack templates.

For more information, please see the user guide:

https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/templates_command/

You can make a new project using these templates by running:

    stack new pniedzielski/template-name

for any of the `template-name.hsfiles` in this repository.
